# Find Maximum Element in a Doubly Linked List (Recursively)

This project implements a recursive function in C to find the maximum integer value in a doubly linked list.

## Problem Statement

Implement a recursive function that finds the maximum element in a doubly linked list, where each node contains an integer value.

The function should take a pointer to the head of the list (or a node) and recursively return the largest value found.

## File

- `findMax_DLL_Rec.c` — Contains the recursive implementation and a simple example usage.

## Example

Given the list:

5 → 8 → 3 → 12 → 7

The function will return:

12
