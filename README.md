# Data Structures and Algorithms in C

This repository contains selected exercises and implementations of fundamental data structures and algorithms written in the C programming language. The focus is on clarity, modular design, and practical problem solving.

Each folder includes a self-contained implementation, and many include unit tests written using the [Acutest](https://github.com/mity/acutest) framework.

## Included Projects

### 1. Doubly Linked List
Implements an abstract data type (ADT) for a doubly linked list with full functionality:
- Node insertion/removal
- Searching, traversal, and printing
- Efficient `AddBefore`, `AddAfter`, and `Remove` operations
- Worst-case time complexity analysis

📁 Folder: `doubly-linked-list/`

---

### 2. Find Maximum (Recursive) in Doubly Linked List
A recursive function that finds the maximum integer value in a doubly linked list.
- Simple recursive logic
- Demonstrates working with pointer-based recursion

📁 Folder: `find-maximum-recursive-dll/`

---

### 3. Recursive Subset Sum to Zero
Recursive solution to determine if a subset of integers exists with a total sum of zero.
- Backtracking approach
- Handles all subset combinations
- Demonstrates clean recursive thinking

📁 Folder: `recursive-subset-sum-zero/`

---

### 4. Infix Expression Evaluator
Evaluates arithmetic expressions written in infix notation by:
- Converting them to postfix
- Evaluating the postfix expression
- Supports `+ - * /`, parentheses, and multi-digit numbers

📁 Folder: `infix-to-postfix-evaluator/`

---

### 5. Insertion Sort on Singly Linked List
Performs insertion sort on a singly linked list of integers.
- Operates in-place (no new node allocation)
- Uses pointer manipulation only
- Modular and testable design

📁 Folder: `insertion-sort-singly-linked-list/`
